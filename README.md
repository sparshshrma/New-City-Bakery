Welcome to "NewCityBakery" repo. In this program I created a program for a bakery shop. In this program we prompt user with a basic form to get their personal details and then later ask the the type of cake they want to order. The options for the cake are round and square. In both choices the user have to put the dimensions of cake they want to order. There are also options provided for the extra toppings or modifications which will add extra cost. At the end when user hit checkout button the final recipt is generated with user details and the total cost.
